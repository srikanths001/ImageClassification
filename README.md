# ImageClassification
Repository contains an implementation for Image classification using SVMs. A set of example data can be used from training and evaluation images.
Also contains a barebone implementation of a nueral network. It contains a two layer network with single hidden layer. It also contains an implementation for optimizing using stochastic gradient descent.
